# Plant-It!
Planning/info app for your backyard garden. Backyard gardening has been a growing hobby(pun intended) especially this crazy year we call 2020. A few of the challenges people run into are not knowing enough details and forgetting what you've planted. One of the features this planting has is a map of the US that will show the zones so you know when to get your garden started. There will be an area where you can choose a vegetable that is already in the database or you can create your own. You can add plants to your garden and plan it out so you're not surprised when a cucumber is growing from where you thought your zucchini was.
